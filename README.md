# dotfiles-win ðŸ’»

Contains my manually backed-up dotfiles for use in Windows machines, and a setup script to quickly bootstrap a Windows installation.

If there is a better way of backing up dotfiles on Windows, please let me know ðŸ˜Š

### Installation

```powershell
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:raphtlw/dotfiles-win.git
cd dotfiles-win
./Setup
```

Remember to omit the `./Setup` line if boostrapping is not necessary (if it isn't a new Windows box).
